interdisciplinary computational science that links the diverse fields of neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology with electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, and physics. Computational neuroscience emphasizes descriptions of functional and biologically realistic neurons and neural systems and their physiology and dynamics, distinguishing it from psychological connectionism and disciplines such as machine learning, neural networks, and computational learning theory.
